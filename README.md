# Semantic Markup

In this project, I built a web page using semantic HTML elements. Semantic markup is really important because:

- It conveys the underlying meaning behind the content and the structure of a web page
- A semantic element tells us about the role of a particular HTML element
- Semantic markup makes a website more accessible as assistive technologies can easily identify different parts of a page.
- Improves developer experience by making HTML code more readable, organized, and maintainable

## Some examples of semantic elements:

- header
- main
- footer
- nav
- section
- article
- aside
- heading elements (h1 - h6)
- summary
- details
- figure
- figcaption
